##how to avoid using username and password when push stuff to github

> 1. generating key pairs

If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form

>git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git

as opposed to

>https://github.com/username/reponame.git

To see your repo URL, run:

>git remote show origin

You can change the URL with:

>git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
